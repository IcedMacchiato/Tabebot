# Tabebot

 Discord bot that recommends highly rated restaurants by Japanese locals from the No.1 food rating website in Japan: Tabelog

 Since I moved to Japan, I've been wanting to try out a new restaurant every day since the food here is amazing. After a week, I realized that picking a restaurant was not as easy as it was back in the States. In Japan, the locals use a website called "Tabelog", which is similar to Yelp in a sense where it allows you to search for the genre of food and the location. However, the Japanese standards are extremely high so the site was known for not having a restaurant being rated over 4 stars (until recently). In a sense, anything over a 3 to 3.5 was already amazing. 
 
 Due to all the options available along with my indecisiveness when it comes to lunch and dinner, I decided to create a discord bot that would randomly suggest me the cuisine and link me to Tabelog's top rated restaurants in Tokyo (where I'm located) as navigating the site on mobile isn't too user friendly yet.
